Transitioning into data science with insurance and underwriting domain expertise.

# Insurance Data Science Portfolio

This repository documents my transition into data science, grounded in deep insurance and underwriting domain expertise.

## Why this repository exists
I am not learning data science for academic interest or certification alone.
My goal is to build portfolio-ready artifacts that demonstrate how insurance judgment,
risk selection logic, and underwriting decision-making can be translated into data-driven analysis.

## Domain focus
The work in this repository is framed around real insurance problems, including:
- Medical and financial underwriting logic
- Risk segmentation and selection
- Exclusions, loadings, and acceptance trade-offs
- Portfolio risk characteristics
- Early-stage automation thinking

## Working principles
- One tangible artifact per day
- Business reasoning before technical polish
- Ugly but real output beats perfect but theoretical work
- Every notebook answers a concrete insurance question
